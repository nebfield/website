    <h1>Science</h1>

    <h2>Academic research</h2>

    <p>During my short academic career, I think I did some particularly cool science:</p>

    <p><cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94498-6">Variations in the oral microbiome are
                associated with depression in young adults</a></cite></p>

    <p>Open science is the bee's knees, so I made sure the <a
            href="https://github.com/nebfield/student-oral-wellbeing">code</a> and <a
            href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB44565">data</a> were publicly available.</p>

    <p>I have also published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XHbvdtcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">other
            work</a>, mostly involving data science or genomic data.</p>

    <p>It would have been nice to publish more things on the human microbiome and mental health, and I did a lot of
        weird and novel metagenomics work, but unfortunately it never saw the light of day for <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayre%27s_law">mysterious reasons.</a></p>

    <p>I don't do independent research anymore because I don't think I was a very good post-doc (I find grinding out
        papers to be unpleasant). I still contribute to research projects as a bioinformatician or data scientist
        sometimes.</p>

    <h2>Patents</h2>

    <p>Although I don't think intellectual property should exist, patents are sometimes used as a signal that academic
        work has translational potential or is especially impactful, so I thought it would be sensible to include this:
    </p>

    <p><cite><a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2021250285">A method of diagnosing
                depression in a subject (PCT/EP2021/065987)</a></cite></p>

    <p>I hope that I never have to speak with a patent lawyer again.</p>
