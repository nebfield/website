    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I always liked computers, but growing up is difficult and school didn't go as well as it should have.
        Choosing the sensible path, I decided to continue my strongest subject at University: molecular and cellular
        biology.
        Studying biology went well, but as a prospective postgraduate student I wanted to try something new, and
        computers sucked me back in ðŸ‘€</p>
    <p>
        Things escalated from there and I ended up with a PhD, specialising in data science and
        bioinformatics.
        I did some scientific research on personalised medicine as a postdoc for a while, but the academic life
        isn't for me.</p>
    <p>Now I work at <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EMBL-EBI</a> building software to support open science.</p>

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>I am not a front end developer so I just wrote plain HTML for the first time since the early 2000s to build this
        site.
        After rereading <a href="http://lissaexplains.com/">lissaexplains.com</a> to refresh my memory, I realised
        <code>&lt;blink&gt;things have changed a bit.&lt;/blink&gt;</code>, so I borrowed CSS from <a
            href="https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/">perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I don't plan to update this site very often, so I'll just upload an archive on <a
            href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a> to deploy it on the information superhighway and
        call it a day.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects">javascript cursor effect</a> reminds me of <a
            href="https://localghost.dev/blog/building-a-website-like-it-s-1999-in-2022/">weird geocities websites</a>
        and I like turtles.</p>
