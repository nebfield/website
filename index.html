    <h2>Software</h2>

    <p>I like to make useful, reliable, and correct <a href="https://github.com/nebfield">open source tools</a> with various excellent people to help nerds do science. </p>

    <p>I also helped to make some data science tools during <a href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/news/2020/july/ulster-researchers-support-the-response-to-covid-19">the pandemic.</a></p>

    <h2>Science</h2>

    <p>During my short academic career, I think I did some particularly cool science:</p>

    <p><cite><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94498-6">Variations in the oral microbiome are
                associated with depression in young adults</a></cite></p>

    <p>Open science is the bee's knees, so I made sure the <a
            href="https://github.com/nebfield/student-oral-wellbeing">code</a> and <a
            href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB44565">data</a> were publicly available.</p>

    <p>I have also published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XHbvdtcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">other
            work</a>, mostly involving data science or genomic data.</p>

    <h2>Patents</h2>

    <p>Although I don't think intellectual property should exist, patents are sometimes used as a signal that academic
        work has translational potential or is especially impactful, so I thought it would be sensible to include this:
    </p>

    <p><cite><a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2021250285">A method of diagnosing
                depression in a subject (PCT/EP2021/065987)</a></cite></p>

    <p>I hope that I never have to speak with a patent lawyer again.</p>
